This application has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, and 14.04, and should work on other later releases
It should work on Debian, and might work on other distro's, written in BASH its portable.

Syncthing Should be installed and running on the host, as user root.
Install syncthing-acl on each server that is running syncthing.

Version
0.4 Alpha , No Warrenty is provided, Syncthing-acl may screw up your user:group ownerships and permissions for all files under the REPOSITORY parent folder.

How Does it work.
Syncthing needs to be setup to have a Folder/Repository that replicates the .acl folder. 
Syncthing-acl assumes that there is a top level folder that contains all Syncthing sync folders, ie you can have as many syncthing folders as you like, as long as they all sit under one master parent directory, this master directory contains a .acl file.
eg
Repository Folder = /export/storage
ACL Folder = /export/storage/.acl
Syncthing has one or more sync folders under the /export/storage parent, ( eg /export/storage/folder1, folder2 etc ) plus one additional syncfolder '.acl'
Users and Groups must exist on all servers.

Prerequisites
i) Install inotify-tools and acl : apt-get install inotify-tools acl
ii) Ensure all syncthing servers are timesynced.

To Install
1) install -t /usr/local/bin -g root -o root -m 0774 syncthing-acl.sh
2) install -t /etc/init -g root -o root -m 0640 syncthing.conf
3) Edit /usr/local/bin/syncthing-acl.sh and edit RESPOSITORY
4) Start the daemon , service syncthing-acl start, output is sent to /var/log/syslog. You can start the process on the commandline if you want to watch it. ( "/usr/local/bin/syncthing-acl.sh" ). You can set the LOGLevel to manage the level of debug.
5) Update/Set your syncthing daemon to replicate the .acl folder ( without any backup or versioning ).
